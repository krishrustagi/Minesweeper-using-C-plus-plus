# Minesweeper_Game
This is Minesweepwer game using C++. 
# Idea
The game is fully developed using c++ and the basic idea of working in C++ without mouse for a minesweeper are the arrow keys. I used some idea of graphics and without using graphics.h the game begins and shows name gets printed on the screen with the flases of the screen in different colors. This can't work on IDEs like VSCode as they doesn't run on command prompt. But some other IDE that is using command prompt for run can be used.
